Then become a software developer. In order to do that, you need to learn a language. My language preference is Python. Python is easy to pick up and yet powerful enough to have been chosen by Google, NASA, and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn Python, here are some good resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com/grids/pydanny/python-books-for-beginners/"&gt;Python books for beginners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These books are great for getting started, but you have to do the work. It takes time and a lot of hard work to get to the point where you are ready to become a software developer. If you stick with working on projects and always finding ways to program things, you'll eventually get to the point where these books become a fond memory of your early days of a Python developer, and you'll start looking for higher level resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've mastered Python, or at least gotten the hang of things, here are some favorite Python programming books meant for more experienced developers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com/grids/pydanny/must-have-python-programming-books/"&gt;Must-Have Python Programming Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my go-to references as a professional software developer. I have both PDF and paper versions of them. They provide answers to sophisticated questions, and make great reading on long trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more Python books then what I've listed here. There are books on Web Development,  Check out the growing compilation of Python books I've assembled at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com/lists/pydanny/complete-list-of-python-programming-books/"&gt;The Complete List of Python Programming books&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Which should you choose?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm not a doctor, I'm not allowed give you medical advice.  Ask your doctor, especially if what you're currently taking isn't working well enough for you.&lt;/p&gt;
