Then become a software developer. In order to do that, you need to learn a language. My language preference is Python. Python is easy to pick up and yet powerful enough to have been chosen by Google, NASA, and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn Python, here are some good resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com/grids/pydanny/python-books-for-beginners/"&gt;Python books for beginners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These books are great for getting started, but you have to do the work. It takes time and a lot of hard work to get to the point where you are ready to become a software developer. If you stick with working on projects and always finding ways to program things, you'll eventually get to the point where these books become a fond memory of your early days of a Python developer, and you'll start looking for higher level resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've mastered Python, or at least gotten the hang of things, here are some favorite Python programming books meant for more experienced developers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com/grids/pydanny/must-have-python-programming-books/"&gt;Must-Have Python Programming Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my go-to references as a professional software developer. I have both PDF and paper versions of them. They provide answers to sophisticated questions, and make great reading on long trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more Python books then what I've listed here. There are books on web development, fancy algorithms, and much more. Please check out the growing compilation of Python books I've assembled at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com/lists/pydanny/complete-list-of-python-programming-books/"&gt;The Complete List of Python Programming books&lt;/a&gt;.
