Ordering vinyl banners can be kind of intimidating.  Here's what you do:

1. Find out the size of the table, booth, or awning where the banner will hang.

If the banners are for a trade show or conference, check the event website to see what size the booths and tables will be.  Contact the organizers if there's nothing on the website.  

If the banners are for an awning, business, fence, or other physical location, go and measure the area where the banner will hang.

Not sure of sizes?  Go with a 6-foot or 8-foot banner with a height of 2-3 feet.
